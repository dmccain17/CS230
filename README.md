The Gaming Room is a client that is planning on creating a game named Draw it or Lose it. They are wanting a web-based game application. They are wanting to expand to different operating systems, as they are currently only available on Andriod. They are wanting the ability to have one or more teams involved, with the having the capabilities to add multple players to each team. They also needed information on different types of operating systems to run a server with, along with the best option for code for a mutli-platform game. 

I believe I did best with their evaluation, as I was able to list the advantages of different server operating systems, along with the disadvantages. This is true for the client side of things as well.

I found it extremely helpful to have a much more clear understanding of what the client is needing and wanting and how to find a path to make them happy. 

If I were to revise anything in this document, it would be the recommendations portion. I would improve it by giving more detail as to what they need recommendations for. 

I was able to interpret the user's needs based off of what The Gaming Room is wanting. Since most of their game is run by their servers, then this means that the client will need less advanced hardware to be able to run the game. It is important to consider the uder's needs because you can easily keep yourself from having more user's if you need extreme requirements to have the ability to the run game. 

The approach that I used when designing the software was taking what the client needed/wanted and then putting it together and then figured out where I needed to begin. I found that finding the appropriate starting point helps immensiley once you have a clear idea of what you are designing.
